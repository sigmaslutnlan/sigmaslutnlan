Sigma solutions loan

Bluevine is a financial technology company that offers lines of credit with relatively low interest rates. You can get lines of credit as large as $250,000, but will only be eligible if you have an established business with nearly $500,000 in revenue each year.

Why Bluevine is best for established businesses: Bluevine only lends to companies that have been around for a couple of years. That gives it the flexibility to offer relatively low interest rates.

Who Bluevine’s line of credit is good for: If you have a seasonal business (like a landscaping or pool-cleaning company) or aren’t sure how much money to borrow, this product could be a good option. Because it’s a line of credit, it allows you to draw money as needed, paying interest only on what you’ve borrowed.
