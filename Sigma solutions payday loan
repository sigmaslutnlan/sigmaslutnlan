OnDeck is an online lender that has been providing small business loans since 2006. Its line of credit lets companies access up to $100,000, which can be paid back in weekly installments over the course of a year.

Why OnDeck is best for building business credit: OnDeck reports your payment history to credit bureaus. If you can repay your line of credit in full and on time, this type of loan is great for building business credit.

Who OnDeck's line of credit is good for: OnDeck’s line of credit is best suited for businesses that need funding as soon as possible and haven’t been able to get approved by other lenders. But since the APRs are so steep, you’ll need to be confident that you can afford to pay back what you’ve borrowed  — or your business credit could take a hit.
